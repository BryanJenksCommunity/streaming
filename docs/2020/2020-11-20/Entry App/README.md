    - [ ] entry fields for
        - [ ] error checking the data types (date format = "YYYY-MM-DD") and no floats
        - [ ] validate integer inputs so that the values match time increments and no hours > 24 type of validation
        - [ ] UID (hidden until using `delete` function)

                    - [ ] new input menu for 6 integer fields for times not date, date is chosen based on UID selection and this is to update so we are only updating integer values
                    - [ ] error checking that no values go too high like hours > 24
- [ ] visualize
    - [ ] button to show visualizations
            - [ ] use matplotlip.pyplot to show chart visuals of productivity
